What is the mean, and how is it used in machine learning?
The mean is the average of a set of values, calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In machine learning, the mean is often used as a baseline to compare model performance and to center data (mean normalization) to improve model convergence.

What is variance, and why is it important in machine learning?
Variance measures the dispersion of a set of values around the mean, calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. In machine learning, variance indicates how much the model's predictions are spread out, which helps in understanding model stability and overfitting. High variance suggests that the model is overfitting the training data.

What is the standard deviation, and how does it differ from variance?
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and represents the average distance of each data point from the mean. While variance gives the spread of the data in squared units, the standard deviation provides a measure in the same units as the data, making it more interpretable.

What is a correlation coefficient?
A correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Values range from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. It is important in feature selection to understand relationships between features.

What is covariance, and how is it different from correlation?
Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. Unlike correlation, which is normalized and thus dimensionless, covariance is not standardized and depends on the units of the variables. Correlation is essentially a normalized version of covariance.

What is the difference between a population and a sample?
A population is the entire set of data or individuals that we are interested in studying, while a sample is a subset of the population. In machine learning, samples are used to estimate properties of the population and to train and test models.

What is the central limit theorem (CLT), and why is it important?
The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the original distribution of the data. This theorem is important because it justifies the use of normal distribution-based techniques in inferential statistics and model evaluation.

What is a z-score?
A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is used to standardize data and to identify outliers. In machine learning, z-scores can be used for feature scaling to ensure that features contribute equally to the model.

What is skewness, and what does it indicate about a dataset?
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a dataset. Positive skewness indicates that the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter, while negative skewness indicates that the tail on the left side is longer or fatter. Skewness helps in understanding the distribution shape and making transformations to meet model assumptions.

What is kurtosis, and how does it affect the distribution of data?
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution. High kurtosis indicates heavy tails and a peaked distribution, while low kurtosis indicates light tails and a flatter distribution. In machine learning, kurtosis helps in understanding the distribution's extremities and potential outliers.
